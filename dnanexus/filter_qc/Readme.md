# ENCODE TF Chip-seq Mapped Read Filter and QC. (DNAnexus Platform App)

Take a raw bam file of mapped reads, filter, calculate QC metrics.

This is the source code for an app that runs on the DNAnexus Platform.
For more information about how to run or modify it, see
https://wiki.dnanexus.com/.
<!-- /dx-header -->

Remove unmapped reads, non-primary alignments, reads failing platform, duplicates, multi-mapping reads, and PCR duplicates.  Additionally, for paired-end data, remove unpaired reads.  Calculate NRF (non-redundant fraction), PBC1, PBC2 (PCR bottleneck coefficient).
